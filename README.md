# Return of the Code
## An Iron Yard Assignment

### Goal
Create a game - the type and topic are open ended, but JavaScript constructors must be used. This is a Star Wars themed game that is best enjoyed with the sound on - C-3PO is chatty and likes to add commentary from time to time. Plus, who doesn't like to hear that opening theme song?

### Description
You are a Jedi trying to save the galaxy. You must travel to various planets and moons in order to complete your mission - you'll see your mission progress on the left side of your control panel. Once you enter a planet or moon's orbit, there are various actions you can take:
* Deploy to location - this will send you out to the planet or moon to interact with the local species. Sometimes they help you, but sometimes they hurt you.
* Initiate Jedi Quest - this will send you on a special Jedi mission, which can be highly rewarding. But be careful! Sometimes you will fail, resulting in a loss of mission progress.
* Exit Orbit - this will send you back out into the galaxy so that you can travel to a new location

### Rules
* You can only visit each location once! If you try to visit the same place twice, your droid pilot will be sure to tell you that you're losing your marbles.
* Similarly, you can only deploy to a location or initiate a Jedi quest at the same location once. If you try to do so, you're on board droid will scold you for wasting precious time.
* Don't mess with the tracking or launch system! Those are for your droid pilot to control and he'll smartmouth you if you mess around. R2D2 is fair game, he has a few different opinions he'll voice if you hover over him.
* Once your mission progress goes below 0% you lose and have failed the entire galaxy. Good job. You'll have to refresh and try again if you want to redeem yourself. Even if you keep trying to go to new locations, your driod pilot will remind you that you're a failure.
* Once your mission progress reaches 100% you win!
